## ⚡ Our Core Philosophy

We believe that a document framework should empower the user, not slow them down. Our development process is guided by four pillars:

* **Lightweight & Minimalist:** We eliminate "bloat" to ensure the fastest possible load times and a clean footprint.
* **High Performance:** Architected for speed, our systems handle large-scale data processing with unmatched efficiency.
* **Rock-Solid Stability:** We prioritize data integrity and system uptime, ensuring a dependable environment for mission-critical tasks.
* **Fluid User Experience:** Our interfaces are designed for "flow"—delivering a smooth, intuitive, and lag-free interaction from start to finish.
